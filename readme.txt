You can get your ActiveCampaign Email Marketing API at http://www.activecampaign.com/api/ 

Maybe problem:
In general hosting has installed php curl already, but maybe some self-managed hosting did not installed php curl, in this case there are 500 error when SYNC accounts between wordpress and ActiveCampaign,
it is generated by ActiveCampaign official API codes, in this case you need install and enable php curl, it is very simple, for examle on ubuntu and php5, the command is:
apt-get install php5-curl, and all things will works well.  

More amazing features are being developed and any feature request is welcome.
